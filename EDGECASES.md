# Edge Cases
## (also list of items I didn't get to)

- Implement Return Books endpoint
- Documentation for API - rswag
- Validating and encrypting cc info
- DB indexes
- Ensure borrower and library are mutually exclusive on LibraryBookCopy
- Potentially extract member endpoints into their own resources scoped to library
- Create service objects for lending/returning
- Revisit serializers to ensure we return the data consumers are looking for, and don't return useless data.  Depending on business requirements consider graphql
